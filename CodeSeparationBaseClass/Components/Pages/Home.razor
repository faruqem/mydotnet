<h1>Code Separation Using Base Class Technique</h1>

<p>Blazor component code separation using a base class involves creating a separate C# file that defines the component's logic and then inheriting from this class in the Razor component. This approach is useful for organizing code, promoting reusability, and making components more maintainable.</p>
<br>
<p>Steps for Implementing Blazor Code Separation with a Base Class:</p>
<p><b>Create the Base Class File:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new C# file in the same folder as your Razor component or in a designated folder for base classes.</li>
    <li>Name this file with a .cs extension, and it's common practice to append "Base" to the component's name (e.g., MyCounterBase.cs for a MyCounter.razor component).</li>
    <li>This class must inherit from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ComponentBase <code><pre>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;</pre></code> <code><pre>public class MyCounterBase : ComponentBase</pre></code></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Inherit in the Razor Component:</b></p>
<ul><li>In your Razor component file (e.g., MyCounter.razor), use the @@inherits directive to specify the base class you created: <code><pre>@@inherits YourAppName.Components.Pages.MyCounterBase</pre></code></li></ul>
<h3>Key Considerations:</h3>
<p><b>Access Modifiers:</b></p>
<p>Members (fields, properties, methods) in the base class that need to be accessed from the Razor component should be declared as protected or public.</p>
<p><b>Naming Conventions:</b></p>
<p>While not strictly required, using a naming convention like ComponentNameBase for your base classes helps in identifying the purpose of the file.</p>
<p><b>Benefits:</b></p>
<p>This approach improves code organization, allows for easier testing of component logic, and facilitates code reuse across multiple components by inheriting from a common base class.</p>
<p><b>Advantage over Partial Class approach:</b></p>
<p>Multiple components can inherit the base class.</p>
